## Quick Install

### Windows

Visit TD-Faust's [Releases](https://github.com/DBraun/TD-Faust/releases) page. Download and unzip the latest Windows version. Copy `faust.dll`, `TD-Faust.dll`, `sndfile.dll`, and the `faustlibraries` folder to this repository's `Plugins` folder. Open `TD-Faust.toe` and compile a few examples.

If you need to compile `TD-Faust.dll` yourself, you should first install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3910/) to `C:/Python39/` and confirm it's in your system PATH. Then you can open a cmd window to this repo's directory and run `call build_windows.bat`.

### macOS

<!-- Visit TD-Faust's [Releases](https://github.com/DBraun/TD-Faust/releases) page. Download and unzip the latest macOS version. Copy `libfaust.2.dylib`, `TD-Faust.plugin`, and the `faustlibraries` folder to this repository's `Plugins` folder. Open `TD-Faust.toe` and compile a few examples.

If there's a warning about the codesigning certificate, you may need to compile TD-Faust on your own computer. -->

MacOS users need to compile TD-Faust on their own computers due to code-signing requirements.

1. Clone this repository with git. Then update all submodules in the root of the repository with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. Install Xcode.
3. [Install CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and confirm that it's installed by running `cmake --version` in Terminal.
4. Install [Python 3.9 universal2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3910/) and confirm it's in your system PATH.
5. In a Terminal window, navigate to the root of this repository and run `sh build_macos.sh`. If you have an Apple Silicon CPU, it will build TD-Faust to be compatible with the [Apple Silicon TouchDesigner builds](https://derivative.ca/download/archive). If you want to build for `x86_64` despite this, you can adjust `build_macos.sh`.
6. Open `TD-Faust.toe`

## Tutorial

### Writing Code

You don't need to `import("stdfaust.lib");` in the FAUST dsp code. This line is automatically added for convenience.

### Custom Parameters in TouchDesigner

* Sample Rate: Audio sample rate (such as 44100 or 48000).
* Polyphony: Toggle whether polyphony is enabled. Refer to the [Faust guide to polyphony](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/midi/) and use the keywords such as `gate`, `gain`, and `freq` when writing the DSP code.
* N Voices: The number of polyphony voices.
* Group Voices: Toggle group voices (see below).
* Dynamic Voices: Toggle dynamic voices (see below).
* MIDI: Toggle whether **hardware** MIDI input is enabled. 
* MIDI In Virtual: Toggle whether **virtual** MIDI input is enabled (**macOS support only**)
* MIDI In Virtual Name: The name of the virtual MIDI input device (**macOS support only**)
* Code: The DAT containing the Faust code to use.
* Faust Libraries Path: The directory containing your custom faust libraries (`.lib` files)
* Assets Path: The directory containing your assets such as `.wav` files.
* Compile: Compile the Faust code.
* Reset: Clear the compiled code, if there is any.
* Clear MIDI: Clear the MIDI notes (in case notes are stuck on).
* Viewer COMP: The [Container COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Container_COMP) which will be used when `Compile` is pulsed.

### Python API

The Faust CHOP's Pyton interface is similar to the [Audio VST CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/AudiovstCHOP_Class).

* `sendNoteOn(channel: int, note: int, velocity: int, noteOffDelay: float=None, noteOffVelocity: int=None) -> None` (**`noteOffDelay` and `noteOffVelocity` aren't used yet**)
* `sendNoteOff(channel: int, note: int, velocity: int) -> None`
* `panic() -> None`
* `sendAllNotesOff(channel: int) -> None`
* `sendControl(channel: int, ctrl: int, value: int) -> None`
* `sendPitchBend(channel: int, wheel: int) -> None`
* `sendProgram(channel: int, pgm: int) -> None`

### Automatic Custom Parameters and UI

One great feature of TD-Faust is that user interfaces that appear in the Faust code become [Custom Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Custom_Parameters) on the Faust Base. If a Viewer COMP is set, then it can be automatically filled in with widgets with [binding](https://docs.derivative.ca/Binding). Look at the simple Faust code below:

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = hslider("Freq", 440, 0, 20000, 0) : si.smoo;
gain = hslider("Volume[unit:dB]", -12, -80, 20, 0) : si.smoo : ba.db2linear;
process = freq : os.osc : _*gain <: si.bus(2);
```

If you compile this with a Faust Base, the Base will create a "Control" page of custom parameters. Because of the code we've written, there will be two Float parameters named "Freq" and "Volume". In order to automatically create a UI, pressing compile will save a JSON file inside a directory called `dsp_output`. These files are meant to be temporary and are deleted each time `TD-Faust.toe` opens.

### Group Voices and Dynamic Voices

The `Group Voices` and `Dynamic Voices` toggles matter when using [polyphony](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/midi/).

If you enable `Group Voices`, one set of parameters will control all voices at once. Otherwise, you will need to address a set of parameters for each voice.

If you enable `Dynamic Voices`, then voices whose notes have been released will be dynamically turned off in order to save computation. Dynamic Voices should be on in most cases such as when you're wiring a MIDI buffer as the third input to the Faust CHOP. There is a special case in which you might want `Dynamic Voices` off:
* You are not wiring a MIDI buffer as the third input.
* `Group Voices` is off.
* You are individually addressing the frequencies, gates and/or gains of the polyphonic voices. This step works as a replacement for the lack of the wired MIDI buffer.

### Control Rate and Sample Rate

The sample rate is typically a high number such as 44100 Hz, and the control rate of UI parameters might be only 60 Hz. This can lead to artifacts. Suppose we are listening to a 44.1 kHz signal, but we are multiplying it by a 60 Hz "control" signal such as a TouchDesigner parameter meant to control the volume.

```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
volume = hslider("Volume", 1., 0., 1., 0);
process = os.osc(440.)*volume <: si.bus(2);
```

In TouchDesigner, we can press "Compile" to get a "Volume" custom parameter on the "Control" page of the Faust base. You can look inside the base to see how the custom parameter is wired into the Faust CHOP. By default, this "Volume" signal will only be the project cook rate (60 Hz). Therefore, as you change the volume, you will hear artifacts in the output. To reduce artifacts, there are three solutions:

1. Use [si.smoo](https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/libs/signals/#sismoo) or [si.smooth](https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/libs/signals/#sismooth) to smooth the control signal: `volume = hslider("Volume", 1., 0., 1., 0) : si.smoo;`

2. Create a higher sample-rate control signal, possibly as high as the Faust CHOP, and connect it as the second input to the Faust base.

3. Re-design your code so that high-rate custom parameters are actually input signals.
```faust
import("stdfaust.lib");
// "volume" is now an input signal
process = _ * os.osc(440.) <: si.bus(2);
```
You could then connect a high-rate single-channel "volume" CHOP to the first input of the Faust Base.

### Using TD-Faust in New Projects

From this repository, copy the `toxes/FAUST` structure into your new project. You should have:

* `MyProject/MyProject.toe`
* `MyProject/toxes/FAUST/FAUST.tox`

and any other files which are sibling to FAUST.tox

Now drag `FAUST.tox` into your new TouchDesigner project, probably near the root. `FAUST.tox` acts as a [Global OP Shortcut](https://docs.derivative.ca/Global_OP_Shortcut). Next, copy `toxes/FAUST/main_faust_base.tox` into the project and use it in a way similar to how it's used in `TD-Faust.toe`.
